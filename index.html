            <p>When you apply for a software engineer job, it is common for the interviewer to say “Tell me about yourself” at the beginning of an interview. Hiring managers often ask this question to encourage you to introduce yourself and share a short summary of your career. Because this question is one of the first in an interview, it's important to answer it successfully. Naturally, by starting the interview well, you can make a good impression and set an optimistic tone for the rest of the discussion.</p>
